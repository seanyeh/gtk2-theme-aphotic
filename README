Aphotic

Aphotic is a simple gtk2 theme based on Aurora Midnight, just a bit 
darker and a light blue foreground color. It requires the Aurora Gtk 
engine, which you can most likely get from your distribution's 
package management tool.

Go to http://wiki.github.com/seanyeh/gtk2-theme-aphotic/screenshots to 
see what it looks like.

Installation:
Like installing any other theme, just extract the archive to ~/.themes

Enjoy!
